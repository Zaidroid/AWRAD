  "communityRole": "Community Role\n\n**AWRAD Community Development Fund (CDF) (Social Responsibility)**\n\nWe want to keep hope alive for ourselves and our children in the quest for a society that embraces the values of love, respect, openness, freedom and democracy. Our children will become the philosophers, scientists, or artists of tomorrow and we have to sustain and reinforce these values for them and for our own well being. We want to contribute to bringing critical thinking alive for youth - analytical debate and dialogue based on a reading beyond the boundary of the text . AWRAD is contributing to the achievement of this quest by creating a Community Development Fund (CDF) to support the dissemination of progressive and humanitarian values. This Fund reflects the commitment of AWRAD to serve the wider community and its national and developmental issues, reinforcing the importance of restoring the spirit of volunteerism and the giving of self in an effective, meaningful context.\n\nAWRAD’s CDF supports a number of initiatives including the publication and dissemination of intellectual, cultural and literature texts that represent a challenge to the prevailing ideology in order to bolster a period of Renaissance and mental and emotional enlightenment. AWRAD’s CDF unlocks the horizon by encouraging individual and independent creative writing, in order to promote intellectual freedom and creativity.\n\nAWRAD’s CDF was established by Dr. Nader Izzat Said, the President of AWRAD in 2009. So far, AWRAD’s Fund has supported the publication of four books, organized awareness promotion activities and sponsored a number of training endeavors with young people.\n\n#### Campaigns\n\nAWRAD supports a number of webpages that aim to promote democracy, secularism and pluralism among youth.
