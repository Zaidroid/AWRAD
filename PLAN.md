# Project Development Plan: AWRAD Website

This document outlines the development plan for the AWRAD website, focusing on delivering a high-quality research platform.

## Phase 1: Functional Development (Core Logic & Data)

The primary goal of this phase is to implement the core functionalities and ensure data is handled dynamically and efficiently.

### 1.1. Dynamic Hero Component (`src/components/Hero.tsx`)
   - **Objective**: Transition the Hero component from static content to dynamic data loading.
   - **Tasks**:
     - [ ] **Data Fetching Implementation**:
       - [ ] Define a clear structure/interface for `featuredPublication` and `trendingPublications` data.
       - [ ] Implement asynchronous data fetching logic (e.g., using `useEffect` and `fetch` or a library like Axios/SWR).
       - [ ] Simulate or connect to a mock API endpoint for initial development if a backend is not yet ready. (e.g. a local `publications.json` file).
       - [ ] Replace hardcoded `featuredPublication` and `trendingPublications` objects with data fetched from the source.
     - [ ] **State Management for Data Loading**:
       - [ ] Implement loading states to provide user feedback during data retrieval.
       - [ ] Implement error handling and display appropriate messages if data fetching fails.
     - [ ] **Internationalization (i18n) Review**:
       - [ ] Ensure all user-facing strings within the Hero component are processed through the `t()` function from `useLanguage` context.
       - [ ] Verify that keys like `hero.subtitle`, `hero.learn_more`, `hero.cta2`, and `trending.title` have corresponding entries in translation files.

### 1.2. Publication & Poll Content Pages
   - **Objective**: Develop dynamic pages to display individual publications and public opinion polls.
   - **Tasks**:
     - [ ] **Routing Setup**: Ensure routes defined in `Hero.tsx` (e.g., `/publications/:id`, `/public-opinion-polls/:id`) are correctly configured in the router.
     - [ ] **Page Components**: Create or refine components for displaying detailed publication/poll content.
     - [ ] **Dynamic Content Loading**: Implement logic to fetch and display content based on URL parameters (e.g., publication ID).

### 1.3. Data Management Strategy (Future Consideration)
   - **Objective**: Plan for a scalable way to manage publication and poll data.
   - **Tasks**:
     - [ ] Evaluate options: CMS, static site generator with markdown, custom backend API.
     - [ ] Define data models/schemas for publications and polls.

## Phase 2: UI/UX Development & Refinement

This phase will focus on enhancing the user interface and experience after the core functionalities are in place.

### 2.1. Hero Component UI/UX
   - [ ] Review and refine the visual design, layout, and responsiveness.
   - [ ] Consider adding subtle animations or transitions for better engagement.

### 2.2. Overall Site UI/UX
   - [ ] Ensure consistent design language across all pages.
   - [ ] Optimize for accessibility (WCAG compliance).
   - [ ] Improve mobile and tablet responsiveness site-wide.

## Phase 3: Backend Development (If Applicable)

If a custom backend is chosen for data management:
   - [ ] Design and implement API endpoints.
   - [ ] Set up database schemas.
   - [ ] Implement authentication/authorization if needed for content management.

## Phase 4: Testing, Optimization, and Deployment

   - [ ] **Testing**:
     - [ ] Write unit tests for critical components and functions.
     - [ ] Conduct integration testing for data flow and component interactions.
     - [ ] Perform end-to-end testing of user journeys.
   - [ ] **Optimization**:
     - [ ] Optimize asset loading (images, scripts).
     - [ ] Code splitting and lazy loading for improved performance.
   - [ ] **Deployment**:
     - [ ] Set up CI/CD pipeline.
     - [ ] Deploy to staging and production environments.
